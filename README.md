# portfoliopage

This is for the first individual project. 
I have created a portfolio page with html5, css3 and javascript. 
I have tried to print current date and time on the page which changes according to the day.
I have also tried to count the remaining days for the particular date using javascript.
I have added layout sketches and wireframe.
